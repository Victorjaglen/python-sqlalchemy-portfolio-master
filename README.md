# Project Portfolio Management


## Description

The Project Portfolio Management application is a web-based platform built with Flask and SQLAlchemy, designed to help users create, manage, and display their projects. Users can add new projects, edit existing ones, and delete projects as needed. Each project can include details such as title, completion date, description, required skills, and a link to its GitHub repository. The application features a user-friendly interface with separate pages for project details, project creation, and editing forms, along with an about page and a 404 error page for better user experience.


## Features
